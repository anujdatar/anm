# Anothe Node Manager

An alternative to [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) for Debian based distributions (for now). Also works for ARM based systems (armv6l, armv7l, arm64).

Only works for Node.js versions with specific distributions for Linux:
 - Node v0.8.6+ (x86, x64)
 - Node v4.0.0+ (armv6l, armv7l, arm64)
