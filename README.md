# Another Node Manager

![version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/anujdatar/anm?label=version&sort=semver)

**DISCLAIMER**: Still kinda beta, I am still tweaking and updating scripts.
Not ready for production just yet. Basic functionality has been tested and is
working fine on Ubuntu on X86_64 and ARM64. Still need to test on other platforms. Will update soon.

A simple and lightweight alternative to
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm). Also works for ARM
based systems, supported architectures armv6l, armv7l, arm64, amd64 (x86_64).

> Wanted something to setup my SBC server projects without the overhead of nvm-sh.

Should technically work on Debian, Fedora, and Arch based systems. Testing being
conducted on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Manjaro.
- Test Systems:
  - X86_64 PC: Ubuntu, Fedora and Manjaro
  - Raspberry PI 3B, 4B: Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, Manjaro
  - Rock64, RockPro64: Armbian, Manjaro
  - Pinebook Pro: Manjaro

Only works for Node.js versions with specific distributions for Linux:
 - Node v0.8.6+ (x86, x86_64)
 - Node v4.0.0+ (armv6l, armv7l, arm64)

## Install
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anujdatar/anm/main/install.sh | bash
```
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anujdatar/anm/main/install.sh | bash
```
This should install to `/home/$USER/.anm`.

The convenience script does the following in case you want to install manually.
  1. Update/upgrade system
  2. Install missing dependencies using your package manager (apt/dnf/pacman)
    - `curl`, `wget`, `git`, `jq`, `python3`, `python3-pip` (`python-pip` if using Arch). Ironically you need either `curl` or `wget to get started. üòù
  3. Install `packaging` (a python package) using `pip`
  4. Clones the [ANM git repo](https://github.com/anujdatar/anm) to `/home/$USER/.anm`
  5. Makes `anm.sh` an executable and creates a symlink in `/home/$USER/.local/bin`

You might have to restart your system, or logout and log back in. Depends. You
should be able to use anm from command line after this.

If you want to use the script without installing, just clone the repository,
install dependencies above, create files named `installed` and `active`. Make
`anm.sh` and executable file `chmod +x anm.sh`. You should now be able to run
ANM from the directory `./anm.sh ls-remote`, `./anm.sh install --lts`, etc.

## Uninstall
Unfortunately this has to be manual for now
  1. Remove the installed directory
    ```
    rm -rf /home/$USER/.anm
    ```
  2. Remove symlink
    ```
    rm /home/$USER/.local/bin/anm
    ```

## Usage
1. List locally installed node versions / releases. Should tell you active version as well.
   ```
   anm ls
   ```
2. List node versions available for install from www.nodejs.org
     - List all available options
       ```
       anm ls-remote
       ```
     - List all LTS releases
       ```
       anm ls-remote --lts
       ```
     - List latest LTS release for a particular version
       ```
       anm ls-remote --lts <release name>  # gallium, fermium, argon, etc
       ```
     - List latest release of each version
       ```
       anm ls-remote --latest
       ```
3. Install a version of NodeJs
     - Install the latest available release
       ```
       anm install
       ```
     - Install the latest LTS version release
       ```
       anm install --lts
       ```
     - Install the latest release of a specific LTS version
       ```
       anm install --lts <release name>  # gallium, fermium, argon, etc
       ```
     - Install a specific release by version number
       ```
       anm install v16.15.0
       ```
4. Uninstall an installed version of NodeJs
   ```
   anm uninstall <version number>  # v16.15.0
   ```
5. Use a particular version of NodeJs
   ```
   anm use <version number>  # v16.15.0
6. Other misc. commands
    ```
    anm --version    # print version of ANM that is installed
    ```
    ```
    anm --path       # print path where ANM is installed, NodeJs binaries in a subfolder here
    ```
    ```
    anm --help       # print help message
    ```

## Thanks
Uses some ideas from [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), but works differently.
Was initially inspired by their work. But when I started this project, I had
issues with NVM on some of my RockChip based SBCs. It works perfectly now, but I
had a few different ideas I wanted to try out for my local servers.

Unlike NVM, ANM does not load it's entire code to the shell profile every time
you launch terminal. But has very limited functionality compared to NVM.
Probably not the most elegant solution, but a learning process for me.
