# Another Node Manager

DISCLAIMER: Still pre-alpha, I am still tweaking and updating scripts. Please DO NOT USE just yet. I will update once basic functionality is tested and is error free.

A simple and lightweight alternative to [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm). Also works for ARM based systems, supported architectures armv6l, armv7l, arm64, amd64 (x86_64).

> Wanted something to setup my SBC server projects. Did not want the overhead of nvm-sh.

Should technically work on Debian, Fedora, and Arch based systems. Testing being conducted on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Manjaro.

  - Raspberry PI 3B, 4B: Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, Manjaro

Only works for Node.js versions with specific distributions for Linux:
